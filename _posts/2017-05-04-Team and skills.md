You may not be able to assemble a large team at the start of the project. However, you should try to build a core group that can take you through the whole project lifecycle. 

Even if your team is one or two people, they will need to play the following roles:

<ul>
<li>A project sponsor</li>
<li>A Product Owner</li>
<li>A developer</li>
<li>A user researcher</li>
</ul>

You may also find it useful to include:

<ul>
<li>A business analyst</li>
<li>A project manager</li>
<li>A subject matter expert</li>
<li>Frontline staff (someone who deals with customers on a daily basis)</li>
</ul>
Discover projects work best when everyone has clear areas of responsibility but the team talks regularly to share what they learn. It's important that team members don't simply read what others have produced but are responsible for ensuring they've understood it and probed it from their own perspective and professional skillset.
