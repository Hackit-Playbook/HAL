title:  Team and skills        
---

During a prototyping phase, it is particularly important to work with a team that can share the understanding of what users need and continue to support the project in the next phase of work. 

 

You would normally expect to be working in a team of 3 and potentially a team as large as 8. Much larger than this and the team may be too big to be cohesive. The team will contain:



<ul>
<li>A project sponsor</li>
<li>A Product Owner</li>
<li>A project manager</li>
<li>A developer(potentially a front-end and back-end developer)</li>
<li>A service designer</li>
<li>A user researcher</li>
<li>A subject matter expert</li>
</ul>


You will also need to draw on the skills of:



<ul>
<li>a Technical Architect for advice on the hosting and infrastructure - including security</li>
<li>A data expert for advice on the data that will be stored and exchanged</li>
<li>Suppliers of existing solutions </li>
<li>Master Data Officers</li>
<li>Information Governance Officers </li>
</ul>
