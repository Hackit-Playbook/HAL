title: Phase 2 - Prototype
---

The purpose of this phase is to understand how you can meet the user needs you identified in discovery and tackle the biggest risks to the project.

 

This is important because sometimes projects move the more complex parts to the end of a project - such as integration between systems or discovering whether users will adopt a new technology. Prototyping enables us to understand how to deliver a solution and whether it will work through real-life testing before we commit further resources to the solution. 

 

A prototyping phase can be valuable to support the introduction of an ‘off the shelf’ solution, particularly if it has been purchased as ‘software as a service’.


<h2>Team and skills</h2>
During a prototyping phase, it is particularly important to work with a team that can share the understanding of what users need and continue to support the project in the next phase of work. 

 

You would normally expect to be working in a team of 3 and potentially a team as large as 8. Much larger than this and the team may be too big to be cohesive. The team will contain:



<ul>
<li>A project sponsor</li>
<li>A Product Owner</li>
<li>A project manager</li>
<li>A developer(potentially a front-end and back-end developer)</li>
<li>A service designer</li>
<li>A user researcher</li>
<li>A subject matter expert</li>
</ul>


You will also need to draw on the skills of:



<ul>
<li>a Technical Architect for advice on the hosting and infrastructure - including security</li>
<li>A data expert for advice on the data that will be stored and exchanged</li>
<li>Suppliers of existing solutions </li>
<li>Master Data Officers</li>
<li>Information Governance Officers </li>
</ul>
A larger product may benefit from the input of a 



<h2>Governance</h2>

The Product Owner will make the day-to-day decisions in response to the insights gathered from users. The key moments for decision-making will be in the activities to estimate the size of the user stories, the prioritisation and the sprint planning workshops. 

 

Beyond the sprint team, the Product Owner will need to explain these decisions to the project sponsor, head of service and possible the Cabinet Member - depending on the prominence of the work. Getting this input in the prototyping phase helps avoid later changes of direction in subsequent phases of work. 

 

At the end of the phase, the team will need to commission an assessment of the work against the Service Standard, consistent with previous phases. This should involve the key members of the ICT Change Advisory Board so that they are sighted on the scope of the project and prepared for any change requests when the project later delivers working solutions into the production environment. 




<h2>Tools</h2>


There are a number of research techniques and workshop-based tools that can help you during a discover phase:
