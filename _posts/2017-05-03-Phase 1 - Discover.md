title: Phase 1 - Discover
---

The discover phase enables you to form a team around a clear understanding of a problem. 

This is important because work often starts because someone believes they’ve found a potential solution and just wants it to be implemented. Sometimes that solution turns out to partially solve the problem, particularly when that problem is complex. If the implementation takes time or costs money the work may have made that problem worse. 

Therefore, the discover phase is useful if a service is considering purchasing a solution ‘off the shelf’ but not if a piece of technology has already been procured.
