Our manifesto says it’s better to take small, quick steps than to embark on long journeys. So you can spend up to two weeks working to develop a project without any formal governance, provided this isn’t at the expense of other work. 

 

To formally initiate a project you will need the agreement of the ICT steering group of the relevant directorate. This needs to clearly express what you’re exploring, what you’d like to achieve (in terms of costs and benefits) and the initial resources required to validate this, so that the Steering Group can make an informed decision. The Business Relationship Manager can get space on the agenda. 

 

Your pitch to the steering group should be proportionate to the resources you're looking to invest in the discovery and the scale of the challenge you're tackling. 

 

At the end of the phase, should you wish to continue with the project, you will need to book an assessment of the work against the Local Government Digital Service Standard. You should look to ask two assessors to hear a presentation capturing what you’ve learnt and how you will move to the next stage. These may be colleagues within ICT but should not be associated with the project. 

 

For larger projects (eg over £100,000 or affecting more than 5,000 residents) you should seek the input of an external assessor. Contact LocalGovDigital  to identify a digital/ICT leader in another local authority that could volunteer their time to conduct the assessment. 

 

Assessments are published on this website.
